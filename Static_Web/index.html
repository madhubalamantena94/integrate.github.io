      <h2>Overview</h2>
      <p>Informatica offers a comprehensive suite of data management services and solutions to help organizations ensure the accuracy, consistency, and security of their data, while also improving data governance and compliance.Informatica Cloud Data Integration tool is a drag and drop tool that extracts, loads and transforms the data from one data source to another data source. The vital motive of this software as a service application is to provide a no code services where user can interact with the application interface, drag the objects from the panel and design the mappings to transfer or copy the data from across various applications. This application has a robust authentication which can be enabled through native methodology and LDAP as well, which will help the organizations to integrate with their single sign on technology. Informatica Cloud provides a wide variety of services like data integration, application integration, data quality, monitoring services, API management, Data governance etc. Access to these services is controlled by the system administrator who will provide grants based on the user roles. A system administrator has the capability to add the users to the system and provide the required privileges to access the services. For the convenience of the explanation, I am taking vital services used by majority of the users. Once the administrator adds the user information in the administrator console, respective users will receive an email to accept the account creation and set up the authentication details. 
The user interaction with the applications starts with login page, where user can provide the username and the password credentials to access the services. If the user forgets the password, they can reset their password through the URL provided on the login page. If the organization enabled the single sign on, user will be redirected to their environment to authenticate and will be entitled to the properties provided by the respective organization.  If the user is logging through native authentication, then user will prompt to provide a one-time password which is sent to the registered email. At this step, the application will identify if the user is administrator or user based on the role assigned to the user. Up on successful login, user will be landed to the services page where user can select their services. At this step, an administrator has the privileges to access the user management console. In the user management console, user can override the normal user information and edit the privileges that the user can perform. On the other hand, admin can also add a new user by providing the PII information which are required for the new profile. In the administration console, system administrator can review the user access metrics through data visualizations like bar charts, graphs, pie charts. In the case of a normal user, they will have the access to the services which are limited based on the role provided by the administrator. For example, a developer can access only the developing services, where as an operator is restricted to the monitoring services. A user can access their respective personal information and can change the details at any desired time, where the details also include changing the password. The login page would be same for both administrators and users, but the information they see up on login will vary. On the other hand, administrators and the users will have access to the customer support
page where they will raise the tickets for any trouble shooting and technical down time. They do not need a separate login rather can navigate through the home page.
